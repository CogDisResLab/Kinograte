<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Kinograte is used for network-based integration of multi-omics datasets. Kinograte is designed to utilize the <a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/ivana.ljubic/research/pcstp/" class="external-link">prize-collecting Steiner forest (PCSF) algorithm</a>. In this case, the goal of the PCSF algorithm is to identify a simplified sub network representative of a disease or a chemical perturbagen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="example">Example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example"></a>
</h2>
<p>Here, we present a simple example on how to use kinograte using three omic datasets (RNASeq, Proteomics, and Kinomics). The package comes bundled with datasets that be used to try out the package. These datasets will be used in this example.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="loading-data">Loading data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The input data for kinograte follow the format of the differential analysis output performed by standard analytic packages which typically consist of three main columns: (gene or protein symbol, log2 fold change (LFC), pvalue). We will use the gene or protein symbol as the feature identifier and either the LFC the pvalue as the metric to score and rank genes/proteins.</p>
